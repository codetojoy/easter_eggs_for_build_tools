NOTE: this project is NOT idiomatic Gradle. For example, it does not use
plugins. It uses Ant-style patterns. I'm including it because it does work,
and shows the flexibility of Gradle.

*** Requirements

- Gradle 0.8
- lower version may or may not be OK

*** Usage 

gradle clean 
gradle compile
gradle test
